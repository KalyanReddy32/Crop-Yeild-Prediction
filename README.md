This focuses on predicting the yield of the crop by applying various machine learning techniques.

The outcome of these techniques is compared on the basis of mean absolute error. 

The prediction made by machine learning algorithms will help the farmers to decide which crop to grow to get the maximum yield by considering factors like temperature, rainfall, area, etc.
